### Ph.D. Candidate in Physics and Astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD

#### Carrie Filion is a recipient of the Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) grant. She is persuing her Ph.D. at the Johns Hopkins University, where she is advised by Professor Rosemary F.G. Wyse. Her research interests include the stellar populations of ultra faint dwarf galaxies, the chemo-dynamics of the Milky Way outer disk, and galactic dynamics in barred galaxies. In her work, she uses dynamical N-body simulations as well as observations of resolved stellar populations of the Milky Way and nearby dwarf galaxies.
