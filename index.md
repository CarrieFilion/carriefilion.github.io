### Ph.D. Candidate in Physics and Astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD

#### I am a recipient of the Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) grant. I am persuing my Ph.D. at the Johns Hopkins University, where I am advised by Professor Rosemary F.G. Wyse. My research interests include the stellar populations of ultra faint dwarf galaxies, the chemo-dynamics of the Milky Way outer disk, and galactic dynamics in barred galaxies. In my work, I use dynamical N-body simulations as well as observations of resolved stellar populations of the Milky Way and nearby dwarf galaxies.

### The low-mass stellar initial mass function in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in any given star formation event. The IMF is a crucial ingredient in modeling how stellar populations and galaxies evolve, and underpins the interpretation of observations across a wide range of topics and scales, from the internal evolution of star clusters to cosmic reionization. Thanks to the long main sequence lifetimes of low-mass stars, most of the low-mass stars born in an ancient stellar population are still alive today. With sufficiently deep observations, we can observe these low-mass stars in nearby galaxies and use these observations to constrain their IMF(s). I am using ultra-deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging to constrain the low-mass IMF of nearby ultra-faint dwarf galaxies 

### Exploring stellar envelopes of nearby galaxies using blue stars
The outskirts of galaxies can tell us about their past evolution and current dynamical state. However, it is difficult to identify candidate members of a given galaxy (especially over a wide field-of-view) from photometric information alone due to the number of Milky Way stars that are also along the line-of-sight. In my recent paper, I identified blue horizontal branch and blue straggler stars that are candidate members of Boötes I over a wide field-of-view using both photometry and astrometry. Blue horizontal branch and blue straggler stars occupy a locus on the color-magnitude diagram that has relatively few sources, and their unique combinations of surface gravity and temperature that make them easily identifiable in broadband photometric color-color diagrams. The set of candidate blue member stars that I identified indicate that Boötes I has quite an extended stellar envelope, and these stars occupy a distribution on the sky that is evocative of tidal features.
