### Ph.D. Candidate in Astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD

I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate at the Johns Hopkins University, where I am advised by Professor Rosemary F.G. Wyse. I research various topics related to galaxy formation and evolution, and I mainly focus on the Milky Way and its neighbors in the Local Group. In my work, I use both observational data and N-body simulations to gain insight into how galaxies and their stellar populations form and evolve.
